//! A typed driver for Byonoy plate readers, speaking their raw USB HID
//! protocol. The Absorbance 96 carries a full session layer; the
//! Luminescence 96 is covered at the report-codec layer.
//!
//! The crate is three cleanly separated layers:
//!
//! - **Report codec** ([`report`]) — pure, no I/O: typed encode and decode
//!   of the 64-byte HID report protocol. Every report's wire form is
//!   testable as bytes with no hardware. The Luminescence 96's reports and
//!   the LED bar reports are covered at this layer only.
//! - **Transport** ([`transport`]) — a blocking
//!   [`transport::HidTransport`] trait over 64-byte packets, with a
//!   `hidapi`-backed implementation behind the `hid` cargo feature and a
//!   scripted mock for tests.
//! - **Session** ([`session`]) — an [`Absorbance96`] handle owning the
//!   transport: discovery and open-by-path, the mandatory reference
//!   measurement and wavelength query on setup, the chunk-reassembling
//!   measurement engine, the post-measurement status gate, and abort.
//!   Measurements come back in the device's own vocabulary:
//!   [`AbsorbanceMeasurement`] rows of `f32` optical density.
//!
//! There is no vendor library anywhere in the stack: the wire protocol is
//! implemented directly over the OS HID layer. The protocol knowledge
//! derives from [PyLabRobot](https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot)'s
//! Byonoy implementation (MIT licensed), the de-facto public specification
//! of this otherwise undocumented protocol. PyLabRobot is reference
//! material only, not a dependency.
